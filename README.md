## 🚀 What is This?

**Machine Psychology** is a modular, Julia-based framework for developing adaptive, interactive, and self-healing AI/ML systems. Inspired by constructivist psychology, this project lets you build agents that don’t just learn—they **form, maintain, and repair their own behavioral logic** over time.

- **Not just machine learning:** Your agents adapt, prune, and boost internal structures through lived experience and feedback.
- **Not just symbolic AI:** Every profile, intent, and logic chain evolves as the system interacts with the world.
- **Not just RL:** Feedback isn’t just a score—it’s a force for internal change and logic health.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Constructivist Learning:** Agents form and update internal models continuously—mirroring human psychological adaptation.
- **Real-Time Adaptation:** Profiles and intent models update live, not just in batch.
- **Self-Healing Logic:** The system can prune, reinforce, or restructure its logic to defend against harmful or adversarial input.
- **REPL/Command Center:** Train, inspect, and simulate agents interactively.
- **Multi-Agent Environments:** Model complex interactions with multiple adaptive agents.
- **Integration-Ready:** Hooks for connecting with external systems, such as Replicode.

## 🧠 Why "Machine Psychology"?

This project goes beyond pattern recognition:
> *Agents here have a “psyche”—they reshape their logic, heal from bad input, and grow through feedback, not just optimize a loss function.*

## 📦 Installation

```julia
# In Julia REPL:
] add https://github.com/obsidianjulua/machine-psychology.git
```

---

## 🚦 Quick Start
Pick any of the starting files.
# Launch the adaptive training REPL
start_training_command_center()

# Or run a batch simulation
run_auto_training_session(...)

# Inspect or update an agent profile
profile = get_user_profile("agent1")
update_profile!(profile, feedback)
```
