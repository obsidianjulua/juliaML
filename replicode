This Julia module, ReplicodeTrainingRegiment.jl, provides a sophisticated framework for automated machine learning
  model training. It's designed to work with a system called "Replicode" by using a shared configuration structure to
  manage and adapt the training process in real time.


  The core idea is to create an "orchestrator" that manages one or more "training pipelines." Each pipeline
  continuously trains a set of machine learning models (like RandomForest, XGBoost) on provided data. During
  training, it monitors performance, automatically switches to the best-performing model, and even adjusts its own
  training parameters (like how much data to sample) based on how well the models are learning.

  How it's Used:

  The intended workflow is demonstrated by the demo_replicode_training function:


   1. Create an Orchestrator: An instance of TrainingOrchestrator is created to manage the entire process.
   2. Configure: The ReplicodeConfig object within the orchestrator is modified to set global parameters for the
      training session (e.g., duration, debug settings).
   3. Provide Data: You need a dataset (X, y) for training. The demo generates synthetic data for this purpose.
   4. Execute Training: The main function execute_automated_training is called with the orchestrator, a unique ID for
      the training pipeline, the training data, and a duration. This kicks off the automated process.
   5. Monitor (Optional): While training is active, you can call monitor_training_progress on the orchestrator to get a
      real-time status update on all active pipelines.
   6. Get Report: Once training is complete, the execute_automated_training function returns a detailed report with
      performance metrics, model usage statistics, and a summary of the session.

  Function Summary:


  Main Structures:
   * ReplicodeConfig: A struct holding dozens of configuration parameters that mirror the settings of a "Replicode"
     runtime. This includes everything from core counts for parallel processing to performance thresholds and debug
     flags.
   * AutomatedTrainingPipeline: Manages the training process for a single set of models. It tracks the currently active
     model, performance history, and adaptive parameters.
   * TrainingOrchestrator: The top-level controller that manages multiple AutomatedTrainingPipeline instances and
     tracks global statistics.


  Core Functions:
   * create_training_pipeline(...): Initializes a new AutomatedTrainingPipeline, configures its models based on the
     Replicode settings, and sets up monitoring.
   * execute_automated_training(...): The main entry point to start a training session. It runs a loop for a specified
     duration, calling training cycles, monitoring performance, and adapting the model as needed.
   * execute_training_cycle!(...): Performs a single iteration of training: it samples the data, trains the current
     model, evaluates its accuracy, and records the performance.
   * monitor_training_progress(...): Prints a formatted status report of all active and inactive training pipelines
     managed by the orchestrator.
   * generate_training_report(...): Compiles and returns a dictionary containing a comprehensive summary and
     performance metrics from a completed training run.


  Adaptive & Helper Functions:
   * configure_models_for_replicode!(...): Adjusts ML model hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees in a random forest)
     based on values in the ReplicodeConfig.
   * should_revise_model(...) & revise_model!(...): These functions implement the core adaptation logic. They check if
     the current model's performance has dropped and, if so, evaluate all available models to switch to the
     best-performing one.
   * check_and_adapt_performance!(...): Dynamically adjusts training parameters. For example, if a model is struggling,
     it might increase the data sampling rate to help it learn better.
   * demo_replicode_training(): A function that runs a complete end-to-end demonstration of the entire system.
